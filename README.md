# Fast brainfuck interpreter

## How it launches

./bf brainfuckProgram.bf

## How it compiles

gcc main.c -o bf -O3

## How it works

This interpreter can only work on linux x86_64
and it works by converting brainfuck code to x86_64 assembly and then executing it
There's a lot of optimization to do.
